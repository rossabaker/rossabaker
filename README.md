# Ross is giving up GitHub

I am [giving up GitHub][give-up-github] for personal use.  Open Source
maintainers need a place that respects their licenses, their time, and
their wishes.  Microsoft ignores our copyrights and copylefts, floods
us with AI slop, and the only way to opt out is to leave.

## Scope

This is an individual decision, limited to repos that are "mine."

I hope to move all group projects, but I prefer consensus to edict.  I
am pushing my collaborators, but not pushing with `--force`.

This does not apply to work.  Their time, their rules.

To minimize user impact, any *original sources* with at least one star
remain archived here, with a final commit appended to the default
`HEAD`.

> [!TIP]
> If you feel the same, you may find this [helper
> script][give-up-github.sh] useful.

## New homes

### Codeberg

[**Codeberg**][codeberg]</dfn> is my home for collaborative open
source.  Codeberg is a community-driven, non-profit platform, and I'm
proud to be a [supporting member][codeberg-join].

> [!TIP]
> Codeberg is free for public repositories with an open-source
> license. [Get started][codeberg-get-started]!

### `git.rossabaker.com`

I self-host [**Forgejo**][self-hosted-forgejo] for [solo
projects][forgejo-ross], [issue reproducers][forgejo-repros],
[forks][forgejo-forks], and [datasets][forgejo-data].  I also mirror
several open source projects of past and present interest.  You are
welcome to [explore][forgejo-explore].

### Opengist

My gists are self-hosted on

proprietary.
