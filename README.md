# Ross is giving up GitHub

I am [giving up GitHub][give-up-github] for personal use.  Open Source
maintainers need a place that respects their licenses, their time, and
their wishes.  Microsoft disregards our copyrights and copylefts,
floods us with AI slop, and the only opt-out is to leave.

## Scope

This is an individual decision, limited to my repositories.

Group projects will move by consensus, not edict.  I will push
collaborators, but I will not push with `--force`.

Work projects are exempt; their time, their rules.

To minimize user disruption, *original sources* with at least one star
remain archived here, with a final commit to `HEAD`.

## New homes

### Codeberg

[**Codeberg**][codeberg] is my home for collaborative open source.  I'm
a proud [supporting member][codeberg-join].

> [!TIP]
> Codeberg is free for public repositories with an open-source
> license. [Get started][codeberg-get-started]!

### `git.rossabaker.com`

I self-host [**Forgejo**][self-hosted-forgejo] for [solo
projects][forgejo-ross], [issue reproducers][forgejo-repros],
[forks][forgejo-forks], and
[datasets][forgejo-data]. [Explore][forgejo-explore] my instance.
