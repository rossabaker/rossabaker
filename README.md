# Ross is giving up GitHub

I am [giving up GitHub][give-up-github] for personal use.  Open Source
maintainers need a place that respects their licenses, their time, and
their wishes.  Microsoft ignores our copyrights and copylefts, floods
us with AI slop, and the only way to opt out is to leave.

## Scope

This is an individual decision, limited to repos that are "mine."

I hope to move group projects, but prefer consensus to edict.  I am
pushing collaborators, but not pushing with `--force`.

This does not apply to work.  Their time, their rules.

To minimize user disruption, any *original sources* with at least one
star remain archived here, with a final commit appended to the default
`HEAD`.

## New homes

### Codeberg

[**Codeberg**][codeberg]</dfn> is my home for collaborative open
source.  I'm proud to be a [supporting member][codeberg-join].

> [!TIP]
> Codeberg is free for public repositories with an open-source
> license. [Get started][codeberg-get-started]!

### `git.rossabaker.com`

I self-host [**Forgejo**][self-hosted-forgejo] for [solo
projects][forgejo-ross], [issue reproducers][forgejo-repros],
[forks][forgejo-forks], and [datasets][forgejo-data].  You are welcome
to [explore][forgejo-explore].
