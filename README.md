# Giving up GitHub

I believe open source communities should prefer open source tools.  I
also believe that open source maintainers need protection from AI
slop, while GitHub is actively building tools that are drowning us in
it.  Therefore, I am [giving up GitHub][give-up-github] for personal
use.

## Codeberg

<dfn>[Codeberg][codeberg]</dfn> is my home for collaborative open
source.  Most new projects will be started there, and I am migrating
established projects as I can.

> [!TIP]
> [Get started][codeberg-get-started] with Codeberg.

## Forgejo

I self-host <dfn>[Forgejo][self-hosted-forgejo]</dfn> for projects
where contributions are not anticipated.  It also mirrors several open
source projects I have associated with.  You are welcome to
[explore][explore-forgejo].

## Vestiges

This GitHub account remains active for work and for open source that
is not mine to move.
