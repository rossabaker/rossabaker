# Ross is giving up GitHub

I believe open source communities should prefer open source tools.  I
also believe that maintainers need their scarce time protected from AI
slop, while GitHub actively builds tools to drown us in it.
Therefore, I am [giving up GitHub][give-up-github] for personal use.

## Codeberg

<dfn>[Codeberg][codeberg]</dfn> is my preferred home for collaborative
open source.  Most new projects will be started there, and I am
migrating established projects as I can.  I'm proud to be a
[supporting member][join-codeberg].

> [!TIP]
> Codeberg is free to join.  [Get started][codeberg-get-started]!

## Forgejo

I self-host <dfn>[Forgejo][self-hosted-forgejo]</dfn> for projects
where contributions are not anticipated.  I also mirror several open
source projects of past and present interest.  You are welcome to
[explore][explore-forgejo].

> [!WARNING]
> Crawlers that ignore robots.txt may receive a [colorless, odorless, 
> and deadly poisonous][iocaine] response.

## Opengist

Gists are now self-hosted on <dfn>[Opengist][self-hosted-opengist]</dfn>.

## Vestiges

This GitHub account remains active for work and for open source that
is not mine to move.

You may find this [helper script][give-up-github.sh] useful in your
own journey to freer pastures.
